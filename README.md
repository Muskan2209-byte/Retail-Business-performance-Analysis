# Retail-Business-performance-Analysis
This project demonstrates an analysis of a superstore's sales data, utilizing Power Query for data transformation, DAX for advanced calculations, and Data Modeling for structuring relationships between tables. The final visualizations are presented through interactive dashboards in Power BI.

# Case Study:
A superstore retail business is a large, multi-department store that sells various products, including groceries, electronics, home goods, clothing, and more. These stores are often designed to be a one-stop shop for customers, offering a wide range of products and services under one roof. Superstores are typically larger than traditional retail stores and may have a larger product selection. Superstores are often part of a larger chain and have multiple locations in a region or country.
